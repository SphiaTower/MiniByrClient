# MiniByrClient
A byr forum client, and also a demo of `AutoPagerRecyclerManager`.

This is one of my early work. A small part of code may be not so elegant and badly designed. I will continue to work on it when I have time.

This repo is also a quick demo of my repo `AutoPagerRecyclerManager`. I don't have time to write full annotations and documentations for this repo, but you can have a look of the readme of `AutoPagerRecyclerManager`. Classes like `BoardFragment` are straightforward implementations of `AutoPagerRecyclerManager`.
